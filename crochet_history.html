        <h1> My Crochet Journey</h1>

        <div class='container'>

            <div id='history_block_1'>
                <p> My crochet journey began in October of 2020. As Ann Arbor was entering a two week undergraduate “lockdown,” my roommate and I determined that we needed to find a new hobby to entertain ourselves over the 14 days. We knew someone else who picked up crocheting and thought that it would be a fun hobby to start. The next morning, I went to Spun, a local Ann Arbor yarn store, and bought two skeins and hooks for us. After the first stitch, we were hooked (literally!). We crocheted almost every night of the two weeks and continued to crochet for many more nights to come. We spent these nights primarily learning the basic stitches (single, half double, double, and triple crochet). </p>

            <div id='history_block_3'>
                <p> After a couple weeks of mastering these stitches, I crocheted my first wearable garment: a green hat. The thrill of completing a project was so incredible that I began working on an assortment of different projects during my two-month-long winter break (see some of the projects here). Once I returned to school, I determined that it was time to start my biggest project yet: a sweater. I spent hours and hours crocheting a bright green sweater. After around a month of work, I debuted my sweater in late February 2021. From there, I slowly began to transition into crocheting more spring/summer items as the academic year progressed.  </p>

                <p> Slowly, my roommate and I incorporated crocheting into our social life. During the second semester of the ‘20-21 school year, we began having crocheting nights with our other roommates. Soon after, we created a GroupMe titled “Ladies who Love Fiber Arts,” a playful space for my friends (and friends of friends) to talk about anything fiber-related. The roster of Ladies who Love Fiber Arts grew as we taught more and more of our friends how to crochet.  </p>

            <div id='history_block_7'>
                <p> Overall, crocheting was the highlight of a very tough 2020. Creating my own garments gave me the creative outlet and break from technology that I had been craving during the first months of the pandemic. For years, I have had short-lived crafting hobbies; crocheting is far different from any of these crafts. Where there is me, there is likely a crochet hook and a skein of yarn.  I look forward to crocheting for years to come!    </p>
